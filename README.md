submitted for MSc Information Technology, Department of Computer Science and Information Systems,
Birkbeck College, University of London.

#Abstract
Museums and galleries make use of technologies to manage their collections and attract visitors
by showing the collection catalogue online. This project aims to develop web application
that displays the collection catalogue of small to mid-sized museums and galleries. 
Enhancing the userâ€™s experience, the search function of items in the online catalogue is one of the key element 
of the system. The system should also be operable by registered staffs to maintain the collection data 
to be displayed on the catalogue. Enabling the system to be used by two types of users, 
it should have authentication functionality.
